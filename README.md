# Ugoki 

Ugoki will be a rather simplistic approach on a fitness workout tracker application.
Why the name Ugoki? Ugoki is the japanese for the word movement, given my love for the culture and lack of original ideas that's what I went with.


## Vision

Ugoki is going to be a workout app tracker. I am not looking into developing anything to specific or over the top. Just enough for me to have a good looking workout tracker.
I want to develop a fun application, for now a **Web application** but for the future I want to make it a **Progressive Web App**, where I can track the exercices I have done, the weights I have used,
the amount of reps and total workout time.

There will be workout plans and also the possibility of creating workout plans. Each exercice will also have videos explaining the proper execution.


## Why creating a workout app like so many others that already exist ?

For the moment, it is not meant to be something different from the other apps, I just want something that is "free" and that I can personalize at my hearts content and fix the things I find
annoying on others app's that I have already payed for and used.
Does not mean that it'll never be anything more that that, because I have a few ideas on how I could make it into something special, but I am not sure on my execution capabilities at the moment, 
or how much time I will be able to spend on it. 

For the moment it's a project I am developing to further my knowledge on the technologies I am using.

## Feedback
Please if you happen to stumble on this project for some reason and you're also an experienced developer. Please, I deeply appreciate any type of feedback and tips on things that you find wrong
with my repo or code! Every bit of feedback helps :) That's one of the reasons why I opened the project.
